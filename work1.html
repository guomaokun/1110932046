        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Recommendation systems are trying to learn the low dimensional representation
            of users and items. Many features can be adopted in recommendation systems,
            for example, user-item interactions, user features, item features, and other in-formation such as the temporal factor.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative filtering-based approaches focus on learning users’ preference
            and predict the items which users will have interest. The sequential relations in
            users behavior are usually ignored in collaborative filtering. In our opinion, the
            trigger relations between items are important for users behavior. For example,
            people usually watch a series of related movies after they watch one of the
            movie in this series. We would like to discover the target items which can trigger
            users to buy as much related items as possible. Therefore, we adopt the social
            influence propagation concept to model the trigger relations between items. In
            social network, people spread influence to their neighbors and receive influence
            from their neighbors at the same time. People usually be activated by their
            friends, family, and followees. Same as the social network, assume an item-item
            network is formed from users’ sequential interaction behavior with item. The
            propagation of item influence can be used to indicate the likelihood of a user
            interacting with a related item based on their interaction with the target item.
        </p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hao-Shang Ma et al.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sequential recommendation research, we consider the sequential information in users behavior. Given the users’ interaction behavior, the problem can be
            defined as predicting the next item which user will interact. However, we would
            like to recommend the next k items which users will interact in the future. First,
            we address the recommendation problem as the next top-k recommendation
            problem. We propose a User Preference Translation Model with item influence
            embedding, abbrev. as UPTM, to solve this problem. In the future, we would
            like to join the social relations between user and propose the social recommendation with UPTM. In addition, the cold start problem is usually ignored in the
            sequential recommendation systems. We will propose a new scheme to deal with
            the cold start problem in UPTM.

        <h3>2.1 Collaborative Filtering with Deep Neural Network</h3>
        <p>
            Collaborative filtering solves the recommendation problem by assuming that
            users with similar behaviors exhibit similar preferences for items. He et al. [2]
            propose NeuMF to combine the multi-layer perceptron and matrix factorization
            to learn the user and item embedding. Wang et al. [4] propose NGCF which is
            based on the graph neural network. They encodes the collaborative signal which
            represents the high-order connectivities by performing embedding propagation.
            Another kind of Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods try to apply
            GAN to recommendation. Chae et al. [1] suggest a new direction of vector-wise
            adversarial training and propose the GAN-based CF framework.

        <h3>2.2 Social Recommendation Systems</h3>
        <p>
            In the current study, recommendations are generated by using previous behavior
            patterns to predict the items that are likely to interest the user in the future.
            In the following, U = {u1, u2, ...um} denotes the user set and I = {i1, i2, ..., in}
            denotes the item set. Each user u has preference record Pu = (iu,1, iu,2, ...iu,t),
            where t is the interactive order. Based on a given Pu, our objective is to recom-mend the next k items Ru = {iu,t+1, iu,t+2, ..., iu,t+k} with which user u is likely to interact.

        <h3>3.2 User Preference Translation Model</h3>
        <p>
            The proposed translation-based recommendation model is illustrated in Fig. 1.
            The model includes a simulation of item embedding and a translation of user
            preferences. The proposed scheme is based on the assumption that users are likely
            to interact with items that are associated with other items that they already
            possess. We propose using influence diffusion to learn the relationships among
            items. We first generate item influence diffusion paths from social influence paths
            sampled from the item-item relation graph from which UPTM learns the item
            influence embedding by which to encode user preferences. UPTM then learns
            the parameters in the hidden layer to output the item embedding and generate
            a recommendation list from the decoder of the translation module, to which is
            applied a softmax function and top-k sampling.

        <h3>3.3 User Preference Translation Model for Social Recommendation</h3>
        <p>
            We would like to apply UPTM on social recommendation by adding the users’
            social relation in the item embeddings. Each user are encoded into a user embedding to represent the user’s social relations in the social network. Then, we
            add the user embedding into the items to translate the user preference.

        <h2>Experimental Results and Future works</h2>
        <p>
            For evaluating the performance of proposed model, we compare UPTM model
            with other existing model on real several datasets such as Movielen, Amazon,
            4 Hao-Shang Ma et al.
            and Yahoo datasets. We use the precision, recall and NDCG metrics to evaluate
            the performance for UPTM. In table 1, we only show the results of NDCG. For
            overall performance comparison, UPTM outperforms other comparing methods
            on three metrics for the next k item recommendation problem. All experimental
            results are shown in our UPTM works [3]. In addition, we will propose the User
            Preference Translation Model with social recommendation. The social recom-mendation consider the users’ preference and users’ social relation simultane-ously.            
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <strong>Table 1.</strong>Overall performance comparison
            <img src="table.jpg" style="float: center;">
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most sequential recommendation cannot deal the cold start problem
            since the new items are not shown in the training process. The sequential recommendation usually ignore this problem. In previous recommendation systems,
            they usually use the popularity of items or the similarity of users’ preference to
            recommend. We would like use the users’ social relation and give the initial item
            embedding for cold start items. We will join this idea to solve the cold start
            problem in UPTM.
